# Phase-3 Project 
My phase 3 project is a sports cards inventory, which can be used to orgnize ones sports cards. One can create players and cards then toggle between the different types of sports, in addition to being able to delete and update cards. 

# Functionality of App
1 - When it first loads youll see a navbar with all players, football, basketball, baseball, and hockey player options.
2 - Then inside each tab you can add a player to the list of players available or just select a player from the current list 
3 - Then after youve selected and clicked on a players name, you will see the list of all of that players cards
4 - Each card listed then has the price, grade, number, signature, and jersey patch information shown. Where you can then either delete that card or update its information.  
5 - If you opt to delete that card, once you click the button the card will dissapear from the list. 
6 - If you chose to update the card, the form on the bottom right will be filled in with the cards information to which you can then change any of the values and then save it. 
7 -  You can also add cards for any player selected, by filling out the add player form and clicking the submit button which will then add that card to the list of that individual players cards 

# Usefullness 
Ive set up the code where it can be used for a multitude of different things, with a few tweaks.  Currently its set up as an inventory organizer for my personal sports cards. But it could also be used to keep track of someone else's own sports cards, as a store inventory, as a sports card finder, or even a collective platform for trading.
